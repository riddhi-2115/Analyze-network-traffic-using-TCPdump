# Analyze-network-traffic-using-TCPdump

## Objective:

The objective of the "Analyze Network Traffic with TCPDump: Build a Logging Tool" is to teach how to use TCPDump, a powerful Linux networking utility, to capture and analyze TCP traffic. By the end of the project, participants will be able to create a logging tool using TCPDump, capture network packets, save them in dump files, and analyze the captured data to gain insights into network traffic1. This hands-on experience is designed to help learners develop skills in network traffic analysis, which are essential for roles in cybersecurity and network administration.

## Skills learnt from project:

Installing TCPDump: Learn how to install and configure TCPDump on a Linux system.
Capturing Network Traffic: Capture live network traffic using TCPDump.
Filtering Packets: Use advanced filtering options to capture specific types of network traffic.
Saving Packet Captures: Save captured network packets into dump files for later analysis.
Analyzing Network Data: Analyze the captured network data to understand the behavior and performance of network traffic.
Building a Logging Tool: Develop a custom logging tool using TCPDump to monitor and log network activity.
Interpreting TCP/IP Traffic: Gain insights into TCP/IP protocols and understand how to interpret the data captured.
