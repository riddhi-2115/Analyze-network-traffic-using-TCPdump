# Analyze-network-traffic-using-TCPdump

## Objective:

The primary objective of this project is to empower learners with practical skills in network traffic analysis using TCPDump and to develop a logging tool. 

- Master TCPDump: Gain proficiency in using TCPDump to capture and analyze network packets.
- Implement Logging: Learn to create a custom logging tool to record and monitor network traffic efficiently.
- Analyze Traffic Patterns: Develop the ability to interpret captured data, identify patterns, and troubleshoot network issues.
- Enhance Network Security

## Skills learnt from project:

Installing TCPDump: Learn how to install and configure TCPDump on a Linux system.
Capturing Network Traffic: Capture live network traffic using TCPDump.
Filtering Packets: Use advanced filtering options to capture specific types of network traffic.
Saving Packet Captures: Save captured network packets into dump files for later analysis.
Analyzing Network Data: Analyze the captured network data to understand the behavior and performance of network traffic.
Building a Logging Tool: Develop a custom logging tool using TCPDump to monitor and log network activity.
Interpreting TCP/IP Traffic: Gain insights into TCP/IP protocols and understand how to interpret the data captured.
